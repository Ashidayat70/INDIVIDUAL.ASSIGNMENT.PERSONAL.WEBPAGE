<h2>AS A STUDENTS:</h2>

Short story I get it life is not that simple, I went to Sultan Ismail College for 5 Years been through a lot fun memories with my friends and the tutors at there but life need to be balance when there are fun there will be sadness lose my friend lose my pride and such but yet life is all about lesson. I learnt my lesson no more fool around, I am a man who have a vision short stories go to s.m.k .kota to further my study on STPM to aim for degree there is little but void there but I went to Politeknik Kota Bharu for a while to be honest I like the atmosphere at there even for 2 months.And here I stood or sit,UiTM Machang to continue my degree on managment Bachelors of Honor in Office System Managment.</P>

<h3>AS SALARYMAN:</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">My first job be honest is working with my dad, however my first job which are get me out from a comfort zone is at Syarikat Muda Osman(SMO). I has worked at company as part-timer on a several ocassion, where as a promoter at SMO Tesco for a month little bit tired but try ignore all those fact cause just one to have an experience as a salaryman. After that, I worked again for the company at book feista at Jubli Perak Hall for almost 2 week the longest hour I ever worked and then for aeon as a promoter for 2 week same story as SMO at the end for SMO at kb mall for a week as promoter. P/s might seem easy but the gap for me to get the job to another job are so long, feel little bit stress as jobless not because I don't have money but because make me fell useless.THE END my experience so far is DONE----.</p>
